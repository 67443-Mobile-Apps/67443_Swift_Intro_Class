//** If you donâ€™t need to compute the property but still need to provide code that is run before and after setting a new value, use willSet and didSet.

//** When working with optional values, you can write ? before operations like methods, properties, and subscripting. If the value before the ? is nil, everything after the ? is ignored and the value of the whole expression is nil. Otherwise, the optional value is unwrapped, and everything after the ? acts on the unwrapped value. In both cases, the value of the whole expression is an optional value. **//
