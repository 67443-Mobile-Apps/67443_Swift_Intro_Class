# Swift Overview Code
This code was presented in lecture introducing the Swift programming language. As indicated in the comments, the material draws heavily from Apple's [Tour of Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/GuidedTour.html). 

There are several branches -- the `students` branch has some code missing because it is part of in-class exercises, while `solutions` has the missing code restored for TA and instructor use in class.
